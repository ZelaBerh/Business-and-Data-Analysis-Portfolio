# 🏨 Hotel Booking Data Analysis  
Welcome to my **Hotel Booking Data Analysis** project! This project demonstrates how I transformed raw booking data into actionable insights using data from Excel and building an informative dashboard on Power BI.  

## 📂 Project Overview  
I worked with a detailed dataset containing over 66,000 hotel booking records to explore customer trends, booking behaviors, and financial performance. Here's a breakdown of the process:  

### 🔧 Data Preparation and Cleaning  
Key steps in preparing the data:  
- **Handled Missing Data**: Ensured completeness by examining potential gaps and inconsistencies.  
- **Standardized Columns**: Unified formats for dates and categorical fields (like location and hotel names).  
- **Removed Duplicates**: Checked for and removed redundant entries to maintain data integrity.  
- **Data Transformation**: Calculated key metrics such as profit margins, discounts, and total stay duration.  

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Insights derived from analyzing the data:  
- **Booking Trends**: Identified patterns in customer bookings based on time, location, and customer demographics.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers by origin, age, and booking preferences.  
- **Hotel Performance**: Analyzed hotel ratings, room occupancy rates, and profitability.  
- **Payment Insights**: Explored payment modes and their impact on booking behaviors.

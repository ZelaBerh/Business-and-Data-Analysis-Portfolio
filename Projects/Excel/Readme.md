# 🍕 Pizza Shop Sales Analysis

Welcome to my **Pizza Shop Sales Analysis** project! This project showcases how I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights using **Microsoft Excel**. 🚀

📂 Project Overview
I started with **four separate CSV files** containing raw sales data and performed the following steps:

* **Data Cleaning**: Ensured consistency and removed errors from the datasets.
* **Data Merging**: Combined all datasets using advanced Excel functionalities like **VLOOKUP** and **INDEX-MATCH**.
* **Data Analysis**: Utilized tools such as:
  * **Pivot Tables** for summarizing and organizing data.
  * **Conditional Formatting** for identifying trends.
  * **Advanced Filtering** for targeted insights.
* **Dashboard Creation**: Built an interactive and dynamic dashboard that allows users to:
  * Filter data by **date, quarters,** and **months**.
  * Visualize key metrics like sales trends, top-performing products, and revenue distribution.

# 🖥️ Features of the Dashboard
* Dynamic charts and graphs to visualize sales performance.
* Easy-to-use filters for custom date ranges.
* Highlighted insights for decision-making.

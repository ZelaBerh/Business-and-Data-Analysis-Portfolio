## 🚗 German Cars Analysis

Welcome to my **German Cars Analysis** project! This project showcases how I transformed raw data about cars in Germany into actionable insights using Python, emphasizing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations. 

### 📂 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of German cars from Kaggle, focusing on identifying trends, outliers, and key features. Here’s what I accomplished:

#### Data Cleaning
- **Handled Missing Data:** Filled missing values and removed irrelevant records.
- **Resolved Duplicates:** Cleaned the dataset for accurate analysis.
- **Standardized Values:** Ensured consistency in categorical and numerical data.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Statistical Summaries:** Explored relationships between features like price, horsepower, and engine capacity.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Identified trends across brands and vehicle types.
- **Key Patterns:** Highlighted insights on fuel efficiency, popularity, and luxury features.

#### Visualizations
- Created **scatter plots**, **bar charts**, and other visuals to bring the data story to life:
  1. **Brand Comparison:** Visualized differences in car pricing and specifications.
  2. **Feature Relationships:** Explored horsepower vs. engine size correlations.
  3. **Market Trends:** Analyzed market segment preferences over time.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- Leveraged **Python libraries** like `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.
- Showcased **data wrangling techniques** to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Used **visual analytics** to convey trends and insights effectively.

### 📸 Snapshots
